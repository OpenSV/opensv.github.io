  <h1>The Plan...</h1>
  <p>The plan for OpenSV is to build an OpenSource Video platform.  It will have everything build into.  The source code be free to use under one of the many OpenSource licenses.  The decision on which license that will be used is still under investigation and will probably depend in part on the licenses used in its component parts.</p>
	<p>In order to fund OpenSV and to promote cost effective video services we will be offering a for profit solution.  The for profit solution will be composed of OpenSV at its core, plust some closed source solutions that provide additional analytics and services that will drive commercial use.</p>
	<p>The logistics on licensing is stil under investigation and will be determined as soon as possible.</p>
	<h1>Architecture</h1>
	<p>The platform is comprised of references to the projects included in the platform.  We put references to the Github repositories and execute git clone commands, then compiling what needs to be compiled on the deployment server.  So, in other words, the contributing packages are not included with the OpenSV sources when you clone our Github repository.</p>
